# Music-player-application
An mp3 music player that allows us to play, stop, and restart tracks, as well as move from one song to the next and previous ones.

Python and associated libraries will be used. The first package we'll use is Tkinter, a widely used GUI toolkit provided by Python. We don't need to install it separately since it's included with Python.
